# Hash table

* Hash table is a special collection that is used to store key-value items. So instead of storing just one value like the stack, array list and queue, the hash table stores 2 values. These 2 values form an element of the hash table. Below are some example of how values of a hash table might look like.


## Challenge 

* Create a list with 1024 None elements, whenever we add a value it will check if it's existed in the location, if there is not(none) it will create a linked list and insert to it, else it will add to the existing linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O :

time -> O(1)
space -> O(1)
