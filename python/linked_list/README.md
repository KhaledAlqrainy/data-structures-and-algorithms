# Challenge Summary
Adding a method in Linked list class where it will add a value and do a multiple test to this value.


## Approach & Efficiency
kth from end : time -> O(n)

# PR link :

to string : return a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"


# Linked list insertions
Upgrading my linked list, add methods to Linked List class which will:

**append** (adding node with the given value to the end of the list)

**insert before** (adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified)

**insert after** (adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified)


## Approach & Efficiency
 Append : time -> O(1)
 Insert : time -> O(n)
InsertBefore: time -> O(n)
InsertAfter: time -> O(n)
