# Trees

* Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called pre_order, in_order, and post_order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

## Challenge

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, left node, and the right node. Also create a BinaryTree class.

## Approach & Efficiency

**Big O :**

Time -> O(n)
Space -> O(1)

**Binary Search Trees**

 A Binary Search Tree is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a binary search tree, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.

## API

Pre-order: root » left » right

In-order: left » root » right

Post-order: left » right » root
