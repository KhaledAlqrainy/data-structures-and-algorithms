# Graph

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Challenge:

* Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge.

## Approach & Efficiency:

Big O:

time -> O(n)
space -> O(1)

## API 

Adds a node.
Adds an edge.
Gets all the nodes.
Gets the neighbors of an input node.
Gets the size of the graph.
